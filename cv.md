## **About myself**
My search for myself began a long time ago. I have been studying pharmacy and also worked in a drug store for a few years. Then I tried myself in a florist shop where I had a lot of communication with people.
Now I work in a corporation and my goal is to move forward!
I'm a very persistent, hard-working and motivated person seeking new experiences and knowledge that will allow me to develop myself.
